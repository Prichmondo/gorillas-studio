                        Gorillas Studio obtains Personal Data about you from various sources to provide our Services and to manage our Sites. “You” may be a visitor to one of our websites, a user of one or more of our Services (“User” or “Gorillas Studio User”), or a customer of a User (“Customer”). If you are a Customer, Gorillas Studio will generally not collect your Personal Data directly from you. Your agreement with the relevant Gorillas Studio User should explain how the Gorillas Studio User shares your Personal Data with Gorillas Studio, and if you have questions about this sharing, then you should direct those questions to the Gorillas Studio User.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            Personal Data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. The Personal Data that you provide directly to us through our Sites will be apparent from the context in which you provide the data. In particular:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you register for a Gorillas Studio account we collect your full name, email address, and account log-in credentials.</li>
                            <li>When you fill-in our online form to contact our sales team, we collect your full name, work email, country, and anything else you tell us about your project, needs and timeline.</li>
                            <li>When you use the “Remember Me” feature of Gorillas Studio Checkout, we collect your email address, payment card number, CVC code and expiration date.</li>
                            <li>When you respond to Gorillas Studio emails or surveys we collect your email address, name and any other information you choose to include in the body of your email or responses. If you contact us by phone, we will collect the phone number you use to call Gorillas Studio. If you contact us by phone as a Gorillas Studio User, we may collect additional information in order to verify your identity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        If you are a Gorillas Studio User, you will provide your contact details, such as name, postal address, telephone number, and email address. As part of your business relationship with us, we may also receive financial and personal information about you, such as your date of birth and government identifiers associated with you and your organization (such as your social security number, tax number, or Employer Identification Number).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        If you are a Customer, when you make payments or conduct transactions through a Gorillas Studio User’s website or application, we will receive your transaction information. Depending on how the Gorillas Studio User implements our Services, we may receive this information directly from you, or from the Gorillas Studio User or third parties. The information that we collect will include payment method information (such as credit or debit card number, or bank account information), purchase amount, date of purchase, and payment method. Different payment methods may require the collection of different categories of information. The Gorillas Studio User will determine the payment methods that it enables you to use, and the payment method information that we collect will depend upon the payment method that you choose to use from the list of available payment methods that are offered to you by the Gorillas Studio User. When you make a transaction, we may also receive your name, email, billing or shipping address and in some cases your transaction history to authenticate you.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When we conduct fraud monitoring, prevention and detection activities, we may also receive Personal Data about you from our business partners, financial service providers, identity verification services, and publicly available sources (e.g., name, address, phone number, country), as necessary to confirm your identity and prevent fraud. Our fraud monitoring, detection and prevention services may use technology that helps us assess the risk associated with an attempted transaction that is enabled on the Gorillas Studio User’s website or the application that collects information.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You may also choose to submit information to us via other methods, including: (i) in response to marketing or other communications, (ii) through social media or online forums, (iii) through participation in an offer, program or promotion, (iv) in connection with an actual or potential business relationship with us, or (v) by giving us your business card or contact details at trade shows or other events.

                    <strong>a. Our products and services.</strong>
                    
                    <p>
                        We rely upon a number of legal grounds to ensure that our use of your Personal Data is compliant with applicable law. We use Personal Data to facilitate the business relationships we have with our Users, to comply with our financial regulatory and other legal obligations, and to pursue our legitimate business interests. We also use Personal Data to complete payment transactions and to provide payment-related services to our Users.
                    </p>
                    
                    <strong>b. Marketing and events-related communications.</strong>
                    
                    <p>
                            We may send you email marketing communications about Gorillas Studio products and services, invite you to participate in our events or surveys, or otherwise communicate with you for marketing purposes, provided that we do so in accordance with the consent requirements that are imposed by applicable law. When we collect your business contact details through our participation at trade shows or other events, we may use the information to follow-up with you regarding an event, send you information that you have requested on our products and services and, with your permission, include you on our marketing information campaigns.
                    </p>
                    
                    <strong>c. Interest-based advertising.</strong>
                    
                    <p>
                        When you visit our Sites or online services, both we and certain third parties collect information about your online activities over time and across different sites to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests (this type of advertising is called “interest-based advertising”). These third parties may place or recognize a unique cookie or other technology on your browser (including the use of pixel tags). Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent prior to processing of your information for the purpose of interest-based advertising.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users based on a range of factors, including demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context (for example, the time and date of your visit to our Sites, the pages that you viewed, and the links that you clicked on). This technology also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and understand if you have seen one of our advertisements.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        We work with Google AdWords, Doubleclick, AdRoll and other advertising networks. To learn how to opt out of behavioral advertising delivered by Network Advertising Initiative member companies, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance. You may download the AppChoices app to opt out in mobile apps. If you opt out from interest-based advertising, you may see advertising that is not relevant to you. At present, there is no industry standard for recognizing Do Not Track browser signals, so we do not respond to them.

                        If you are a Customer of a Gorillas Studio User, please direct your requests directly to the User. For example, if you are making, or have made, a purchase from a merchant using Gorillas Studio as a payment processor, and you have a request that is related to the payment information that you provided as part of the purchase transaction, then you should address your request directly to the merchant.
